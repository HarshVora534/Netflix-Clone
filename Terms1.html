        Netflix provides a personalized subscription service that allows our members to access entertainment content (“Netflix content”) over the Internet on certain Internet-connected TVs, computers and other devices ("Netflix ready devices").
        <br>
        <br>
        These Terms of Use govern your use of our service. As used in these Terms of Use, "Netflix service",
        "our service" or "the service" means the personalized service provided by Netflix for discovering and
        accessing Netflix content, including all features and functionalities, recommendations and reviews, our websites, 
        and user interfaces, as well as all content and software associated with our service. References to ‘you’ in these Terms of Use
        indicate the member who created the Netflix account and whose payment method is charged.

    <h5 style="padding-left: 70px;padding-top: 20px;">
        1.1. Your Netflix membership will continue until terminated. To use the Netflix service you must have Internet access and a Netflix ready device, and provide us with one or more Payment Methods. “Payment Method” means a current, valid, accepted method of payment, as may be updated from time to time, and which may include payment through your account with a third party. Unless you cancel your membership before your billing date, you authorize us to charge the membership fee for the next billing cycle to your Payment Method (see "Cancellation" below)

        1.2. We may offer a number of membership plans, including memberships offered by third parties in conjunction with the provision of their own products and services. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties. Some membership plans may have differing conditions and limitations, which will be disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available to you. You can find specific details regarding your Netflix membership by visiting the netflix.com website and clicking on the "Account" link available at the top of the pages under your profile name.

    <h5 style="padding-left: 70px;padding-top: 20px;">
        We may from time to time offer special promotional offers, plans or memberships (“Offers”). Offer eligibility is determined by Netflix at its sole discretion and we reserve the right to revoke an Offer and put your account on hold in the event that we determine you are not eligible. Members of households with an existing or recent Netflix membership may not be eligible for certain introductory Offers. We may use information such as device ID, method of payment or an account email address used with an existing or recent Netflix membership to determine Offer eligibility.

    <h5 style="padding-left: 70px;padding-top: 20px;">
        <span><b><u>3.1. Billing Cycle.</u></b></span> The membership fee for the Netflix service and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the service, such as taxes and possible transaction fees, will be charged to your Payment Method on the specific payment date indicated on the "Account" page. The length of your billing cycle will depend on the type of subscription that you choose when you signed up for the service. In some cases your payment date may change, for example if your Payment Method has not successfully settled, when you change your subscription plan or if your paid membership began on a day not contained in a given month. Visit the netflix.com website and click on the "Billing details" link on the "Account" page to see your next payment date. We may authorize your Payment Method in anticipation of membership or service-related charges through various methods, including authorizing it for up to approximately one month of service as soon as you register. If you signed up for Netflix using your account with a third party as a Payment Method, you can find the billing information about your Netflix membership by visiting your account with the applicable third party.

To the extent permitted by the applicable law, payments are non-refundable and we do not provide refunds or credits for any partial membership periods or unused Netflix content. To cancel, go to the "Account" page and follow the instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your membership, your account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period. To see when your account will close, click "Billing details" on the "Account" page. If you signed up for Netflix using your account with a third party as a Payment Method and wish to cancel your Netflix membership, you may need to do so through such third party, for example by visiting your account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from the Netflix service through that third party.
